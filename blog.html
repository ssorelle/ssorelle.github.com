<p>Bear with me - a future daily project will be to flesh out my Blog Page.  Until then it's going to be pretty basic.</p>

<p id="midparagraph">Day 1: Made my home page and I think it's OK for a first attempt in one day.  I'm not a designer or artist so it's definitely not the most beautiful thing in the world but I believe everything works.  One of my future projects will be to become one with Media Queries and make the page perfectly responsive.  Now I need to decide what to do for my next project (and make dinner).
