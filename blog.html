<p>Bear with me - a future daily project will be to flesh out my Blog Page.  Until then it's going to be pretty basic.</p>
<hr>
<p id="midparagraph">Site 1: Made my home page and I think it's OK for a first attempt in one day.  I'm not a designer or artist so it's definitely not the most beautiful thing in the world but I believe everything works.  One of my future projects will be to become one with Media Queries and make the page perfectly responsive.  Now I need to decide what to do for my next project (and make dinner).
</p>

<p id="midparagraph">Site 2:  Today I made a little page called "Surprise Click" - it was a blast and gave me a chance to break out some jQuery and a couple of conditional statements.  The surprise pages should change with the holidays. If all goes well, at midnight my images will change to a Day of the Dead theme - complete with a Mexican guitar serenade.  Fingers crossed.</p>

<p id="midparagraph">Site 3: Finished the "Draw a Mondrian" page much more quickly than I had expected (hooray for JQuery!) and my "Surprise Click" page successfully transitioned to its new theme at midnight last night -  very exciting!  I'm taking tomorrow to celebrate the Day of the Dead and think about the next few pages.  I really want to learn how to build a shopping cart purely with HTML/JavaScript.  This page might be broken into daylong milestones to become a multi-day project (is that cheating?).
