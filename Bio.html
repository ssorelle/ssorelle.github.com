<p>Below is my (very dull) professional bio.  I apologize for this sad little placeholder.  A much better bio is coming soon. </p>
<p id="midparagraph"><b style="text-transform: uppercase;">Sarah SoRelle:</b> I have a diverse background in Software Development, Marketing and Project Management.  My experience ranges from working for Fortune 100 companies to being the third employee at a small, bootstrap startup. While working in each of these roles, my goal has always been to utilize technology to improve processes and increase productivity (I love metrics!). I became interested in programming and web development while managing web-centric projects where I was deeply involved in the technical details. Dev Bootcamp was the perfect opportunity for me to fully immerse myself in this amazing field and start on the path to becoming a world-class developer.</p>
